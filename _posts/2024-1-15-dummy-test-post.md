title: Dummy Test Post

This is a dummy test post to verify that new posts are working correctly with the updated blog structure.

## What This Tests

- New posts should appear in the main section (not in "Old Posts from 2021")
- The post should be displayed normally with title, excerpt, and "Read More" link
- The styling should match other recent posts

## Expected Behavior

This post should appear at the top of the blog, before the "Old Posts from 2021" section, since it's in the main `_posts` folder and not in the `old-posts-2021` subfolder.

You can delete this post after testing the functionality.
